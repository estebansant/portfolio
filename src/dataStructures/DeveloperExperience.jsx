        details: 'This is by far my biggest project until now. It is the personal project that I used to practice and master React JS. It took a long time to develop, beacuse I was also learning new things while I progressed with it. I found a lot of obstacles in the way, but eventually I could sort them out. Despite taking me so much time to develop it, I am really proud of it and is the project that I love the most of all the things that I have coded this far.'

        details: 'I developed a whole website for a consulting agency in Argentina called "Istmo Consultores". I took care of the design and creation of the code from scratch. I did not want to make the project complicated because it is a relatively small website, so I decided to build it using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. It was a contract job, so once I finished the website, the job ended.'

        duration: '3 months',
        details: 'This was my first big personnal project. From the beginning I knew that The Scientific Room was not going to be small, and I ended up coding a lot of lines of code in HTML, SCSS and JavaScript to make this website work with all the videos that are displayed on it. I am really satisfied with the final result, because it was a test of how well I could solve problems on my own while coding, and without the help of a teacher.'

        details: 'The day after I wrote my first line of code, I decided to buy a subscription in Platzi, where I started to learn the basics things about coding. HTML, CSS and JavaScript were the first steps in my path to become a programmer. I continue to learn new things there, and the most important thing that I rescue from Platzi is "to never stop learning".'
