It took a long time to develop, beacuse I was also learning new things on the way; I found a lot of obstacles while building it, but eventually I could sort them out. I am really proud of it and is the project that I love the most of all the things that I have coded this far.'

I ended up writing a lot of lines of code in HTML, SCSS and JavaScript to make this website work with all the videos that are displayed on it.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript were the first steps in my path to become a programmer. I continue to learn new things there, and the most important thing that I rescue from Platzi is "to never stop learning".'
